# Django Tea

Is a set of helper modules for developing command line, web and gui
applications using the django framework.

It's just a personal collection of modules that I found myself copying from
project to project.


## Installation


```bash
pip install django-tea
```

Add `django-tea` to `INSTALLED_APPS`:

```python

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...,
    "django_tea",
    ...,
]
```
